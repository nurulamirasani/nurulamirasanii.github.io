<p align="center">Assalamualaikum ... and welcome to my website &hearts;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>So I have to say something about myself. Sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with. Let me give a try to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope that my impression about myself and your impression about me are not so different. Here it goes.
</strong>
<p align="center"><strong>I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, I like to get up late, I like to be surrounded by people. I like country&rsquo;s peace. I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like to take some scenery. YES ! Im a mobilegraphy . I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.

<h4 align="center">&quot;Peace is the beauty of life. It is sunshine. It is the smile of a child, the love of a mother, the joy of a father, the togetherness of a family. It is the advancement of man, the victory of a just cause, the triumph of truth.|'</h4>
<h4 align="center">- Menachem Begin-</h4>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"> <strong> I cannot imagine living my life without my family by my side. Family is very important and valuable to me and is something that should never be taken for granted. Without my family, a large part of my life and culture would be missing.</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Whether it's my grandparent, my two sisters, my mom, or my dad, I know I can always count on someone to help me feel better. In fact, I think that this is probably the most important thing that my family has taught me; a family is made up of people who you can trust and who you can count on. Too many times today, we read in the papers about families where parents abuse their children, verbally and physically. What these parents don't realize is that they are either beginning or involving themselves in a vicious circle of hate in families. When parents abuse their children, they are telling their children that that is the way to raise children, and this is what their children learn. I was lucky, I have learned differently, because my family cares about me, and I care about them. </strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><br />
  In this world of doubt, insecurity, and fear, my family is always there for me, holding their arms open to me with love. On the first day of first grade, I didn't want to go to school, I had butterflies in my stomach and I found it difficult to walk because I was so nervous. The only reason that I finally went into the classroom is because my mom walked in with me, and promised me that as soon as school was out, she'd be there waiting for me, ready to bring me back to where I felt most comfortable, my family. </strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong> Luckily, I'm a little more grown up now; I can go into school by myself, and in a couple of years, when I go away to college, I'll really have to go to school by myself. There will be no one who I will know at college. Of course I know I'll make friends, but none of them will mean as much to me as my family does. However, I don't know exactly what I'll miss most about my family. I know that I'll miss about them .</strong></p>
